# Privacy Policy for Pulse

**Last updated: November 3, 2025**

## The Short Version:
Pulse stores your tasks and timer settings locally on your device. We don't collect, store, or sell your personal data. If you connect Spotify, we only access what's needed to control playback - we don't store your listening history.

## What Data We Collect

### Stored Locally on Your Device:
- Your task lists and completion status
- Timer preferences (work/break durations)
- App settings and preferences

**This data never leaves your device. We can't see it, access it, or share it.**

### Spotify Integration (Optional):
When you connect Spotify, we:
- Request permission to control playback (play/pause, volume)
- Access your current playback state
- Do NOT store your listening history, playlists, or personal Spotify data
- Only communicate directly between your device and Spotify's servers

## What We Don't Collect:
- No analytics or tracking
- No email addresses or account creation
- No location data
- No usage statistics
- No advertising identifiers

## Third-Party Services
**Spotify:** If you choose to connect Spotify, your use of Spotify is governed by Spotify's Privacy Policy.

## Data Storage and Security
All app data is stored locally on your device using standard secure storage mechanisms. We do not operate servers that store your information.

## Children's Privacy
Pulse does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. The app does not require any personal information to use.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this privacy policy occasionally. Changes will be posted at pulsetimer.dev/privacy with an updated date.
